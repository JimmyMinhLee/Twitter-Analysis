# Summary
Use this application to livestream sentiment surrounding Tweets. 

The longer you run it, the better of a picture you'll get. You can see the streamed tweets in real time. 

## Pre-requisites 
1. Python3+ 
2. Vader Sentiment Analysis and TweePy. 

You'll also need to get some API Keys from Twitter. You can do so by looking up their documentation. Add your key and token, as well as their secret codes, into a file called apikeys.py. The application will load them in for you. 

I'll make a pip requirement file soon. This is a rough markup.
